                <h1>Summer 2025 Roadmap</h1>
                <p>
                    After graduation, the summer of 2025 neither require nor expect any active research and coding. However,
                    I think some interesting initiatives should be highlighted. After all, what if we get bored from
                    doing nothing (aside from our day jobs).
                </p>
                <h2>Main events</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025" hreflang="en" target="_blank">Game Jam 2025</a>.
                        A wildcard for having fun and crafting a cool little game.</li>
                    <li>Ehhh, I dont know any other events.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Side Quests (Curated by V. Krylov)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Update the DDSRC website. There should be a proper homepage, about page, blog page (maybe),
                        roadmap page also. Prospects seem endless here.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pimp my code. Almost like
                        <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BA%D1%83_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BA%D1%83" hreflang="ru" target="_blank">
                            Pimp my ride</a>,
                            but for the GitHub repos. The idea is: we iterate over our repos, and examine
                            the possibilities for improvement. Adding user I/O, README with Usage instructions. Maybe,
                            we will see opportunities for new features in some of our pet projects. That could be fun.
                    </li>
                    <li>Linux course for MMCS. Yeah, that was an interesting idea. Revisiting it could be cool.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>I've run out of ideas at this point ðŸ˜ž. But maybe you haven't! If so, feel free to append any of the lists
                    or create new ones by
                    <a href="https://github.com/DDSRC/ddsrc.github.io" hreflang="en" target="_blank">sending a PR</a>.<br>
                    We are a team, you know.
                    </li>
                </p>
